# VIKRANTA - Project Documentation

Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-11-05

This document provides a complete, consolidated description of the VIKRANTA Tourist Registry System — its purpose, architecture, design, implementation details, technology stack, security posture, deployment and operational notes, testing strategy, and recommended next steps.

## 1. Purpose & High-Level Summary

VIKRANTA is a blockchain-backed Tourist Registration and Verification System designed to:
- Provide a secure, auditable register of tourists using Ethereum smart contracts.
- Provide a short, human-friendly unique ID for tourists used for login and verification.
- Allow tourists to upload documents (stored on IPFS) and obtain a digitally-signed PVC card and QR code for offline verification.
- Offer an authority panel for authorized personnel to review, verify, or reject registrations.
- Preserve privacy by storing only encrypted sensitive data; use hashes and references on-chain.

Primary goals:
- Security and auditability (immutable records on-chain).
- Privacy by design (AES encryption + IPFS references instead of storing raw PII on-chain).
- Practical usability (short IDs, downloadable PVC cards, QR codes for offline checks).

## 2. Existing System vs Present (This Implementation)

- Existing (Problem space): Manual tourist registrations and paper-based identity verification. Lack of portable cryptographic verification, centralized tamper-prone storage, and weak audit trails.
- Present (This project): A decentralized, auditable tourist registry with clear verification workflows, authority controls, downloadable PVC cards and QR codes, encryption, and hardened deployment in Docker + Nginx.

  - `css/style.css`, `js/` scripts, `logo.png`
- `migrations/`, `build/` - Truffle artifacts
- `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile.backend`, `Dockerfile.deployer`, `nginx.conf`, `ssl/`
- `README.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md`, `LOGO_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`, many docs in `/docs`

## 5. Detailed Architecture

High-level components:

1) Frontend (Static):
   - Static pages served by Nginx.
   - Web3 integration for wallet-based interactions (MetaMask) when tourists or authorities interact directly.
   - Registration flows call backend REST endpoints for server-side registration and PDF generation.

2) Backend API (Express):
   - Serves API endpoints under `/api/*` for tourist registration, document upload, verification workflows, PVC generation, and health checks.
   - Uses a server-side master wallet (HD wallet provider) for signing registration transactions when performed server-side.
   - Interacts with the smart contract via `web3` and the compiled ABI in `build/contracts/TouristRegistry.json`.
   - Uploads documents to IPFS and stores the resulting hashes on-chain.
   - Provides JWT-based protected routes for authority panel operations.

3) Blockchain Layer (Ganache / Ethereum):
   - `TouristRegistry.sol` stores tourist records keyed by short `uniqueId`.
   - Events emitted for registration, verification, rejection, QR generation, and expiration.
   - Authorities are addresses controlled by admin and added/removed via contract calls. Contract enforces `onlyAuthority` modifier.

4) Storage Layer (IPFS):
   - Documents (images, PDFs) uploaded by tourists or authorities are stored in IPFS. Backend stores IPFS hashes linked to uniqueId.

5) Proxy & SSL (Nginx):
   - Nginx terminates TLS and serves static frontend from `/usr/share/nginx/html` and proxies API requests to the backend where applicable. Self-signed SSL used in dev; recommended to use Let's Encrypt in production.

6) Orchestration (Docker Compose):
   - Services: `blockchain` (ganache), `backend` (node app), `nginx` (reverse proxy), and `deployer` for migrations.

Data flow (registration):
  Tourist → Frontend form → POST /api/tourist/register → Backend encrypts sensitive data, generates unique ID, registers on-chain using master account → Backend returns uniqueId & txHash → Frontend shows success & QR/PVC actions.

Verification flow:
  Authority logs in (JWT) → Sees pending list (pulled from off-chain authority queue or contract events) → Verifies via `/api/authority/verify` → Backend writes verification details on-chain (verifyTourist) and triggers PVC/QR generation.

Expiration flow:
  Background service `expirationChecker` periodically checks contract `expirationDate` and marks records as inactive if expired, emitting events and optionally notifying authorities.

## 6. Smart Contract Summary (`TouristRegistry.sol`)

- Stores `Tourist` struct and `Document` array per uniqueId.
- Mappings:
  - `mapping(string => Tourist) public tourists;`
  - `mapping(string => Document[]) public touristDocuments;`
  - `mapping(address => bool) public authorities;`
  - `mapping(address => string) public addressToUniqueId;`
- Admin (contract deployer) can add/remove authorities.
- `registerTourist(...)` ensures uniqueness and emits `TouristRegistered`.
- `uploadDocument(...)` stores IPFS hashes in `touristDocuments` and emits `DocumentUploaded`.
- `verifyTourist(...)` is `onlyAuthority`, sets `isVerified`, `qrCodeHash`, `verificationDate`, `expirationDate`, emits `TouristVerified` and `QRCodeGenerated`.
- `rejectTourist(...)` and `checkExpiration(...)` implemented with events.

Security notes:
- No PII stored on-chain — only encrypted/masked references and IPFS hashes used.
- Authority operations restricted by `authorities` mapping and `onlyAuthority` modifier.

## 7. Backend Implementation Details

- `backend/server.js` wires security middleware (helmetConfig, corsOptions, sanitizeInput), body parsers with size limits, and rate-limiting. It also mounts `frontend` as static files.
- Routes:
  - `/api/tourist/register` — creates short unique ID, encrypts sensitive data, and calls contract `registerTourist` using master account.
  - `/api/tourist/upload-document` — accepts file upload (multer), pins to IPFS, stores hash via contract call.
  - `/api/verify` or `/api/authority/*` — protected by JWT, used by authority panel for listing pending verifications and performing verify/reject actions.
  - `/api/tourist/pvc-card/:uniqueId` — generates/sends PVC card PDF using PDFKit.
  - `/api/tourist/health` — health check returned for Docker healthchecks.

- Utilities:
  - `utils/encryption.js` — AES-256-CBC encryption and decryption helpers using `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from env.
  - `utils/qrGenerator.js` — consistent QR payload format, hashing, and image generation.
  - `utils/pvcCardGenerator.js` — draws professional PVC card layout, embeds QR, and streams PDF.

- Wallet & Transaction Helpers:
  - `config/wallet.js` & `@truffle/hdwallet-provider` used to sign/send transactions from server master account.

## 8. Frontend Implementation Details

- Static pages rendered from `frontend/` directory with responsive CSS and progressive enhancement.
- Pages:
  - `home.html` — landing page, icons, project overview
  - `portal.html` — portal card links to registration/login
  - `tourist-auth.html` — tourist registration/login UI and form submission to backend
  - `dashboard.html` — tourist dashboard with personal data, QR and PVC preview
  - `authority-login.html` & `authority-panel.html` — authority login and verification UX

- Interaction patterns:
  - Tourist registration is primarily backend-driven to centralize blockchain writes via master account and avoid requiring every tourist to have ETH.
  - Optional wallet-based flows (MetaMask) supported for authority or advanced users to sign transactions directly.

## 9. Security & Privacy

Security was a primary design constraint. Implementations include:

- Network & Container Hardening
  - Docker Compose binds critical services to localhost and uses internal networking.
  - Containers run as non-root user (`node`) where possible.
  - Capabilities dropped and `no-new-privileges` applied for extra container hardening.

- Transport Security
  - Nginx terminates TLS. Self-signed certs provided for dev; recommend Let's Encrypt for prod.

- Application Security
  - Helmet for headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP).
  - Rate limiting for /api endpoints.
  - Input sanitization middleware to guard against XSS and injection.
  - JWT auth with refresh tokens for protected authority routes.

- Data Privacy
  - Sensitive PII encrypted using AES-256-CBC with server-side `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
  - Only encrypted payloads and IPFS hashes stored on-chain; raw PII never written to blockchain.

- Audit & Logging
  - Events from smart contract used as an audit trail.
  - Backend logs security events in `logs/` with rotation recommended.

## 10. Deployment & Operations

Docker Compose orchestrates services. Key recommendations:

- Development
  - `docker-compose up -d` to bring up Ganache, backend, nginx, and deployer.
  - Use `npm run migrate` inside deployer to deploy contracts (or let deployer container run migrations on startup).

- Production
  - Replace Ganache with production Ethereum node or managed provider (Infura/Alchemy or self-hosted Geth/Nethermind).
  - Use Let's Encrypt for TLS; use managed secrets for sensitive env vars (ENCRYPTION_KEY, JWT_SECRET, MNEMONIC).
  - Use a CI/CD pipeline to build Docker images, run tests, and deploy to staging/production.

Health checks and monitoring
- Docker healthchecks for backend are configured (calls `/api/tourist/health`).
- Add monitoring/alerts (Prometheus/Grafana, or hosted alternatives).

## 11. Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests (Smart Contracts)
  - Truffle tests for contract functions: registration, verify, reject, expiration checks.

- Integration Tests
  - API tests that spin up a test blockchain (Ganache) and the backend, testing `/api/*` endpoints, IPFS integration, and PVC generation.

- End-to-End
  - Full flow tests: Register tourist → Upload document → Authority verification → Download PVC.

- Security Tests
  - Pen tests for injection points, XSS, auth bypass, and rate limit enforcement.

## 12. API Reference (Concise)

Public Tourist APIs:

- POST /api/tourist/register
  - Body: { name, email, phone, nationality, passportNumber, dateOfBirth, address }
  - Returns: { success, uniqueId, transactionHash, walletAddress }

- POST /api/tourist/upload-document
  - multipart/form-data: document file + { uniqueId, documentType }
  - Returns: { success, ipfsHash }

- GET /api/tourist/pvc-card/:uniqueId
  - Returns: PDF stream for PVC card

Authority APIs (JWT protected):

- POST /api/authority/login
- GET /api/authority/pending
- POST /api/authority/verify
- POST /api/authority/reject

## 13. Configuration & Environment Variables

Essential environment variables (examples):

- NODE_ENV=production
- PORT=3000
- BLOCKCHAIN_PROVIDER=http://blockchain:8545
- CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
- ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-char key>
- JWT_SECRET=<secret>
- REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<secret>
- MNEMONIC=<12-word> (only for deployer/master wallet)

Store secrets in environment or secret manager. Do not commit `.env` to repo.

## 14. Operational Considerations

- Backups: Periodically snapshot Ganache/chain data if using local chain (production will use remote nodes).
- Key Management: Use secure vault for master wallet mnemonic; consider hardware wallet for production signing.
- Log Rotation & Retention: Configure logrotate for `logs/` to avoid disk exhaustion.
- Certificate Renewal: Automate Let's Encrypt renewals.

## 15. Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

- Currently uses Ganache for local testing; in production use full node or provider.
- Consider moving verification logic off-chain for heavy workloads, keeping only final approvals on-chain.
- Provide an SVG logo and multi-resolution favicons for sharper branding on high-DPI devices.
- Add web-based QR scanner for authorities (mobile-friendly).
- Integrate advanced analytics and monitoring.

## 16. Diagrams (ASCII)

Simple component diagram:

  [Tourist Browser]
        |
        | HTTPS
        v
     [Nginx] <---> [Backend API] <--> [Ganache/Ethereum]
        |               |                 ^
        |               |                 |
   static files      IPFS client       Truffle artifacts (ABI)

Sequence (Register):

  Tourist -> POST /api/tourist/register -> Backend:encrypt -> Backend:registerTourist(tx signed by master) -> Contract emits TouristRegistered -> Backend returns uniqueId & txHash

## 17. How to Run Locally (Quick)

Prerequisites: Docker Desktop or Node.js & npm, Truffle, Ganache (optional)

With Docker (recommended):

  docker-compose up -d

Open `https://localhost` in your browser (self-signed certs may require accepting). Use `http://localhost:3000` for backend API.

Manual (no Docker):

  npm install
  npm run ganache        # start local ganache (script expected)
  npm run migrate       # deploy contracts
  npm run dev           # start backend
  open frontend/index.html

## 20. Detailed File & Code Explanation

This section explains each major file/directory, its purpose, and why it exists in the system.

### Smart Contracts (`contracts/`)

**File: `TouristRegistry.sol`**
- **Purpose**: Core blockchain contract for tourist registration and verification
- **Why Used**: Provides immutable, auditable storage of tourist records; enforces access control rules on-chain
- **Key Features**:
  - Stores tourist structs with metadata (name, nationality, encrypted data hash, verification status)
  - Maps uniqueId → Tourist for easy lookup
  - Authority management (only admin can add/remove authorities)
  - Event emissions for off-chain indexing and audit trails
- **Code Highlights**:
  ```solidity
  struct Tourist {
      string uniqueId;
      string name;
      bool isVerified;
      uint256 expirationDate;
      // ... other fields
  }
  mapping(string => Tourist) public tourists;
  ```
- **Why Blockchain**: Ensures no single party can alter records; provides transparency and trust

**File: `Migrations.sol`**
- **Purpose**: Truffle migration tracking contract
- **Why Used**: Tracks which migrations have been deployed to avoid re-deploying contracts
- **Note**: Standard Truffle boilerplate; required for `truffle migrate` command

### Backend (`backend/`)

**File: `server.js`**

  - Serve static frontend files
  - Mount API routes (`/api/tourist`, `/api/authority`)
  - Start expiration checker service
  - Provide health check endpoint for Docker
- **Code Pattern**:
  ```javascript
  app.use(helmetConfig);           // Security headers
  app.use(cors(corsOptions));      // Cross-origin control
  app.use('/api/', apiLimiter);    // Rate limiting
  app.use('/api/tourist', touristRoutes);
  ```
- **Why Express**: Lightweight, flexible, extensive middleware ecosystem

**Directory: `routes/`**

**File: `tourist.js`**
- **Purpose**: Tourist-facing API endpoints (registration, document upload, info retrieval, PVC download)
- **Why Used**: Encapsulates all tourist-related business logic in one module
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `POST /register` - Creates new tourist record, encrypts data, calls smart contract
  - `POST /upload-document` - Accepts file upload, pins to IPFS, stores hash on-chain
  - `GET /pvc-card/:uniqueId` - Generates PDF PVC card on-the-fly
  - `GET /info/:uniqueId` - Retrieves tourist info from blockchain
- **Code Pattern**:
  ```javascript
  router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
      const uniqueId = generateShortId();
      const encryptedData = encrypt(JSON.stringify(sensitiveData));
      const receipt = await signAndSendTransaction(tx);

## 21. Comprehensive Q&A About the Project

### General Questions

**Q1: What problem does VIKRANTA solve?**
**A:** VIKRANTA solves the problem of manual, paper-based tourist registration systems that are prone to fraud, tampering, and lack of verification. It provides a blockchain-based, cryptographically secure system for registering tourists, verifying their identities, and issuing portable credentials (QR codes and PVC cards) that can be verified offline.

**Q2: Why use blockchain for tourist registration?**
**A:** Blockchain provides:
- **Immutability**: Records cannot be altered or deleted once written
- **Auditability**: Complete history of all changes with timestamps
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
- **Trustlessness**: Verifiable by anyone without trusting a central authority
- **Transparency**: All transactions are publicly auditable

**Q3: Is tourist personal data stored on the blockchain?**
**A:** No. Only encrypted hashes and references are stored on-chain. Sensitive personal information (email, phone, passport number, address) is encrypted using AES-256 before being hashed and stored. The plaintext data never touches the blockchain, preserving privacy while maintaining verification capability.

**Q4: How is privacy maintained?**
**A:** Privacy is maintained through multiple layers:
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted with AES-256-CBC
- **Minimal on-chain data**: Only hashes, not plaintext
- **IPFS for documents**: Files stored off-chain with content-addressed hashes
- **Access control**: Smart contract enforces who can read/write data
- **Server-side encryption keys**: Only backend server can decrypt data

**Q5: What happens if the backend server goes down?**
**A:** The blockchain data remains intact and accessible. However:
- New registrations would be temporarily unavailable (backend signs transactions)
- Existing records can still be verified by querying the blockchain directly
- Documents on IPFS remain accessible via any IPFS gateway
- PVC cards already downloaded remain valid offline
- A new backend instance can be spun up and reconnected to the same contract

### Technical Architecture Questions

**Q6: Why use Ganache for development instead of a public testnet?**
**A:** Ganache provides:
- **Speed**: Instant block mining (no waiting)
- **Control**: Deterministic accounts, balances, and state
- **Cost**: No need for testnet ETH
- **Privacy**: Local testing without exposing data
- **Reproducibility**: Reset state easily for testing
- **Offline development**: No internet required
For production, migrate to a public network or private consortium chain.

**Q7: Why does the backend sign transactions instead of users?**
**A:** Design decision to improve UX:
- **No ETH required**: Tourists don't need cryptocurrency or wallets
- **Simplified onboarding**: No MetaMask installation or setup
- **Gas fee abstraction**: Backend pays transaction costs
- **Broader accessibility**: Non-technical users can register
- **Trade-off**: Backend becomes a trusted party for registration (but verification is still decentralized)

**Q8: How are authorities authenticated?**
**A:** Two-factor authentication:
1. **Wallet-based auth**: Authority connects MetaMask (proves ownership of Ethereum address)
2. **Passphrase auth**: Additional secret passphrase stored server-side
3. **JWT token**: After successful auth, JWT issued for subsequent API calls
4. **On-chain verification**: Smart contract checks if address is in `authorities` mapping

**Q9: What prevents unauthorized authorities from verifying tourists?**
**A:** Smart contract enforces authorization:
- Only addresses in `authorities` mapping can call `verifyTourist()`
- Only admin (contract deployer) can add/remove authorities via `addAuthority()` / `removeAuthority()`
- `onlyAuthority` modifier reverts transactions from non-authority addresses
- All authority actions emit events for audit trails

**Q10: How does the expiration system work?**
**A:** Three-layer expiration mechanism:
1. **Contract storage**: Each tourist has `expirationDate` timestamp set during verification
2. **Background checker**: `expirationChecker.js` service runs periodically, queries blockchain for expired records
3. **On-demand check**: Anyone can call `contract.checkExpiration(uniqueId)` to mark expired records inactive
4. **View function**: `isValid(uniqueId)` returns false if expired, preventing reliance on stale data

### Security Questions

**Q11: How does the system prevent DDoS attacks?**
**A:** Multiple layers of protection:
- **Rate limiting**: `express-rate-limit` restricts requests per IP (e.g., 100/15min)
- **API endpoint protection**: Rate limiter applied to all `/api/*` routes
- **Nginx**: Can add additional rate limiting at reverse proxy level
- **Docker isolation**: Services isolated in containers
- **Firewall**: Production should use firewall rules to block malicious IPs

**Q12: What security headers are implemented?**
**A:** Helmet.js sets:
- **HSTS** (Strict-Transport-Security): Force HTTPS for 1 year
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY (prevent clickjacking)
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff (prevent MIME sniffing)
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restrict resource loading to same origin
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enable browser XSS filter (legacy browsers)
- **Referrer-Policy**: Control referrer information leakage

**Q13: How is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevented?**
**A:** Multiple defenses:
- **Input sanitization middleware**: Strips HTML/script tags from all inputs
- **CSP headers**: Restrict inline scripts and external script sources
- **Output encoding**: Frontend frameworks should encode output (not using Angular/React here, but good practice)
- **Validation**: `express-validator` ensures data format correctness

**Q14: What if someone steals the ENCRYPTION_KEY?**
**A:** High-risk scenario:
- **Impact**: Attacker could decrypt sensitive tourist data stored on blockchain
- **Mitigation**:
  - Store `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
  - Rotate keys periodically
  - Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage in production
  - Monitor access logs for suspicious decryption attempts
- **Best practice**: Implement key rotation mechanism and re-encrypt data with new keys

**Q15: How are brute force attacks prevented?**
**A:** `bruteForceProtection.js` middleware:
- Tracks failed login attempts per IP address
- Blocks IP after X failed attempts (e.g., 5)
- Returns 429 (Too Many Requests) with retry-after header
- Resets counter after successful login or timeout
- Can be extended to use Redis for distributed rate limiting

### Data & Storage Questions

**Q16: What is IPFS and why use it?**
**A:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):
- **What**: Peer-to-peer distributed file system
- **Why**: 
  - Decentralized (no single server controls files)
  - Content-addressed (hash = proof of content)
  - Permanent (files persist as long as one node pins them)
  - Censorship-resistant (no central authority can remove files)
- **Use case**: Store tourist documents (ID scans, photos) without centralized cloud storage
- **Alternative**: Could use AWS S3, but IPFS aligns with decentralization philosophy

**Q17: How are IPFS hashes stored?**
**A:** Smart contract stores IPFS hashes in `touristDocuments` mapping:
```solidity
mapping(string => Document[]) public touristDocuments;
struct Document {
    string documentType;
    string ipfsHash;  // e.g., "QmXabc123..."
    uint256 uploadDate;
    bool isVerified;
}
```
- **Retrieval**: Anyone with uniqueId can query contract for IPFS hashes, then fetch files from IPFS network

**Q18: What if IPFS goes down or files are lost?**
**A:** IPFS relies on pinning:
- **Pinning**: Ensures files persist on specific nodes
- **Solutions**:
  - Run your own IPFS node and pin all documents
  - Use IPFS pinning services (Pinata, Web3.Storage)
  - Maintain backup copies on traditional storage
  - Implement redundancy (multiple IPFS nodes)
- **Hash verification**: Even if file is lost, hash proves what content should be; can re-upload if original is available

**Q19: How large can uploaded documents be?**
**A:** Configured in `multer` middleware:
- **Current limit**: 10 MB per file
- **Reason**: Prevent server resource exhaustion
- **Can increase**: For large files (e.g., video), increase limit or implement chunked uploads
- **IPFS**: Handles large files well (chunked automatically), but upload time increases

**Q20: Where are logs stored?**
**A:** Backend logs stored in `logs/` directory:
- **Security logs**: Authentication attempts, authorization failures
- **API logs**: Request/response details (IP, endpoint, status code)
- **Error logs**: Application errors and stack traces
- **Recommendation**: Implement log rotation (logrotate) and ship logs to centralized system (ELK stack, Splunk)

### Blockchain & Smart Contract Questions

**Q21: Can the smart contract be upgraded?**
**A:** Current design: No. Contracts are immutable once deployed.
- **To enable upgrades**: Implement proxy pattern (e.g., OpenZeppelin's TransparentUpgradeableProxy)
- **Trade-off**: Upgradability introduces trust assumptions (admin can change logic)
- **Alternative**: Deploy new contract version and migrate data (expensive)

**Q22: What happens if Ganache loses data?**
**A:** In development:
- **Impact**: All registrations, verifications, and contract state lost
- **Solution**: Use Ganache's `--database.dbPath` flag to persist data to disk
- **Docker Compose**: Already configured with volume mount (`blockchain-data:/app/db`)
- **Production**: Use persistent blockchain (mainnet, testnet, or private chain with backups)

**Q23: How much does a transaction cost?**
**A:** Gas costs (in ETH):
- **registerTourist**: ~150,000 gas (~$0.50 - $5 depending on gas price)
- **verifyTourist**: ~100,000 gas
- **uploadDocument**: ~80,000 gas
- **Ganache**: Free (local development)
- **Production**: Backend pays gas fees; can optimize contract code to reduce costs

**Q24: Can tourists verify themselves without internet?****A:** Yes, via QR codes:
- **QR contains**: Tourist data + cryptographic hash
- **Verification process**:
  1. Authority scans QR code (offline QR scanner app)
  2. Extracts data and hash
  3. Recalculates hash from data
  4. Compares calculated hash with QR hash
  5. If match, data is authentic
- **Limitation**: Cannot check real-time blockchain status (e.g., if tourist was later revoked); hash only proves data hasn't been tampered

**Q25: What blockchain events are emitted?**
**A:** Smart contract emits:
- `TouristRegistered(string uniqueId, address touristAddress, uint256 timestamp)`
- `DocumentUploaded(string uniqueId, string documentType, string ipfsHash)`
- `TouristVerified(string uniqueId, address authority, uint256 verificationDate, uint256 expirationDate)`
- `TouristRejected(string uniqueId, address authority, uint256 timestamp)`
- `QRCodeGenerated(string uniqueId, string qrCodeHash)`
- `TouristExpired(string uniqueId, uint256 timestamp)`
- **Use**: Off-chain indexing (The Graph, event listeners), audit trails, real-time notifications

### Deployment & Operations Questions

**Q26: How do you deploy to production?**
**A:** Steps:
1. **Provision infrastructure**: Cloud VM (AWS EC2, Azure VM) or Kubernetes cluster
2. **Configure production Ethereum node**: Use Infura, Alchemy, or self-hosted Geth/Nethermind
3. **Update docker-compose.yml**: Change `BLOCKCHAIN_PROVIDER` to production node URL
4. **Secure secrets**: Use AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `MNEMONIC`
5. **SSL certificates**: Replace self-signed certs with Let's Encrypt or purchased SSL
6. **Domain & DNS**: Point domain to server IP
7. **Deploy contracts**: Run `truffle migrate --network production`
8. **Update CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Set in production .env
9. **Start services**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
10. **Monitor**: Set up health checks, logging, and alerts

**Q27: How do you scale the backend?**
**A:** Horizontal scaling strategies:
- **Load balancer**: Nginx or cloud LB (AWS ALB) in front of multiple backend instances
- **Stateless design**: Backend is stateless (JWT tokens, no sessions), easy to replicate
- **Database**: If adding DB (Postgres, MongoDB), use managed service or replication
- **IPFS**: Use IPFS cluster or pinning service for redundancy
- **Blockchain**: Read-only operations can use multiple RPC endpoints; writes go through master wallet (bottleneck)

**Q28: How do you monitor the system?**
**A:** Monitoring stack:
- **Application metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana for CPU, memory, request rates, error rates
- **Health checks**: Docker healthchecks, Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
- **Logs**: Centralized logging (ELK stack, Splunk, CloudWatch)
- **Blockchain monitoring**: Track contract events, gas usage, transaction failures
- **Uptime monitoring**: UptimeRobot, Pingdom for external checks
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty, Slack, email for critical errors

**Q29: How do you backup the system?**
**A:** Backup strategies:
- **Blockchain data**: If using Ganache with volume mount, snapshot volume daily
- **IPFS data**: Pin files to multiple nodes, backup IPFS repo directory
- **Database** (if added): Automated daily backups with retention policy
- **Contract code**: Source code in Git (GitHub), immutable on-chain
- **Environment config**: Secure backup of .env files (encrypted)
- **SSL certs**: Backup private keys securely

**Q30: What is the disaster recovery plan?**
**A:** Recovery scenarios:
1. **Backend crash**: Restart container, data on blockchain persists
2. **Blockchain node failure**: Switch to backup RPC provider, redeploy if necessary
3. **IPFS data loss**: Restore from pinning service or backup nodes
4. **Complete infrastructure loss**: Redeploy from Git repo, reconnect to existing contract (immutable), restore IPFS pins
5. **Contract bug**: No easy fix (immutable); deploy new contract version, migrate users

### Development & Testing Questions

**Q31: How do you run tests?**
**A:** Testing commands:
```bash
# Unit tests (Truffle contract tests)
npm run test

# Specific test file
truffle test tests/test-registration.js

# Backend API tests (if using Mocha/Jest)
npm test

# End-to-end tests (if using Cypress/Playwright)
npm run e2e
```

**Q32: What testing frameworks are used?**
**A:**
- **Smart contracts**: Truffle test suite (Mocha + Chai)
- **Backend API**: Mocha, Chai, Supertest for HTTP testing
- **E2E**: Cypress or Playwright for browser automation
- **Coverage**: Solidity-coverage for contract code coverage

**Q33: How do you test authority verification workflow?**
**A:** Test scenario:
1. Register tourist via API
2. Authenticate as authority (get JWT token)
3. Call `/api/authority/pending` to see tourist in list
4. Call `/api/authority/verify` with uniqueId and validity period
5. Query blockchain to confirm `isVerified = true` and `expirationDate` set
6. Emit event assertions to verify `TouristVerified` event

**Q34: How do you debug blockchain transactions?**
**A:** Debugging techniques:
- **Console logs**: `console.log()` in Solidity (uses Events internally)
- **Truffle debugger**: `truffle debug <txHash>` for step-through debugging
- **Ganache logs**: Watch transaction details in Ganache output
- **Event logs**: Parse emitted events from transaction receipts
- **Revert reasons**: Custom error messages in `require()` statements
- **Etherscan** (testnet/mainnet): View transaction details, contract state

**Q35: How do you handle contract deployment in CI/CD?**
**A:** CI/CD pipeline:
1. **Build**: Compile contracts with `truffle compile`
2. **Test**: Run `truffle test`
3. **Deploy** (if tests pass):
   - Use dedicated deployment key/wallet
   - Deploy to testnet first (e.g., Sepolia)
   - Verify contract on Etherscan
   - Update backend .env with new `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
4. **Docker build**: Build backend image with new ABI
5. **Deploy backend**: Push to registry, update orchestration (K8s, Docker Compose)

### User Experience Questions

**Q36: How do tourists log in after registration?**
**A:** Login flow:
1. Tourist navigates to `tourist-auth.html`
2. Enters their `uniqueId` (received after registration)
3. Frontend calls `/api/tourist/info/:uniqueId`
4. Backend queries blockchain for tourist data
5. If found and active, backend returns decrypted data
6. Frontend redirects to `dashboard.html?uniqueId=ABC123`

**Q37: What if a tourist loses their uniqueId?**
**A:** Recovery options:
- **Email recovery**: If email was provided, backend can send uniqueId via email (requires email→uniqueId mapping)
- **Authority assistance**: Tourist contacts authority with ID documents, authority looks up record
- **No recovery**: If no fallback, tourist must re-register (design choice)
- **Best practice**: Implement email/phone recovery flow

**Q38: Can tourists update their information after registration?**
**A:** Current design: No on-chain updates (immutability).
- **Workaround**: Register new record with updated data, mark old as inactive
- **Alternative**: Add `updateTourist()` function with audit trail (tracks all changes)
- **Trade-off**: Updates reduce immutability benefits

**Q39: How long does registration take?**
**A:** Timing breakdown:
- **Form submission**: Instant
- **Backend processing**: ~100ms (encryption, ID generation)
- **Blockchain transaction**: ~2-15 seconds (Ganache: instant; mainnet: varies)
- **Frontend update**: ~500ms (fetch data, render dashboard)
- **Total**: 3-16 seconds typical

**Q40: What browsers are supported?**
**A:** Frontend requirements:
- **Modern browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (latest 2 versions)
- **MetaMask support**: Chrome, Firefox (for authority login)
- **Mobile**: Responsive design works on iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- **IE11**: Not supported (uses modern ES6 features)

### Integration & API Questions

**A:** Yes, via REST API:
- **Authentication**: JWT token or API key (implement API key system)
- **Endpoints**: All `/api/*` endpoints can be called programmatically
- **Response format**: JSON
- **Rate limiting**: Same limits apply as web frontend
- **Webhooks**: Can implement webhook system to notify on events

**Q42: Is there an API documentation?**
**A:** Current state: Basic docs in README.

**A:** Not implemented yet, but can add:
- **Library**: Nodemailer for sending emails
- **Use cases**:
  - Send uniqueId after registration
  - Notify tourist when verified/rejected
  - Send expiration warnings
  - Authority alerts for new pending registrations
- **Configuration**: SMTP server credentials in .env

**Q44: Can tourists receive SMS notifications?**
**A:** Possible with third-party service:
- **Services**: Twilio, AWS SNS, Nexmo
- **Use cases**: Send uniqueId via SMS, verification status updates
- **Implementation**: Add phone number to registration, integrate SMS API

**Q45: Is there a mobile app?**
**A:** No native app, but:
- **PWA**: Frontend can be converted to Progressive Web App (add manifest.json, service worker)
- **Responsive design**: Already works on mobile browsers
- **Native apps**: Could build React Native or Flutter app that calls same REST API

**Q47: Can the system support multiple currencies?**
**A:** Currently free for tourists (backend pays gas). Future options:
- **Payment gateway**: Integrate Stripe, PayPal for registration fees
- **Cryptocurrency**: Accept ETH, stablecoins (USDC) for fees
- **Wallet integration**: Tourist pays gas directly if they have wallet

**Q48: Can authorities be tiered (different permission levels)?**
**A:** Possible enhancement:
- **Current**: Binary (authority or not)
- **Future**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Super admin: Can add/remove authorities
  - Verifier: Can verify tourists only
  - Auditor: Read-only access
  - Regional authorities: Can only verify tourists from specific regions
- **Implementation**: Add `roles` mapping in contract, check role in modifiers

**Q49: Can the system handle multiple countries/regions?**
**A:** Yes, with enhancements:
- **Current**: Single deployment, all tourists in one registry
- **Scaling**:
  - Deploy separate contracts per country/region
  - Add `region` field to tourist struct
  - Implement cross-border verification protocols
  - Federation model: Multiple VIKRANTA instances interoperating

**Q50: What is the long-term vision for VIKRANTA?**
**A:** Vision:
- **Global adoption**: Standardized tourist verification across countries
- **Interoperability**: Integration with airport systems, hotels, travel agencies
- **Self-sovereign identity**: Tourists own and control their data
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Prove attributes (age, nationality) without revealing full identity
- **Decentralized governance**: DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for system governance
- **Open standard**: VIKRANTA protocol adopted as international tourist verification standard
